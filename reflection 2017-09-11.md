I forgot I made this repository. It's nice to look back once in a while.

I learned today how to patch commits the way torvalds/linux expects. `git commit --interactive` gives you most of the instructions.
I'd like to learn to use git better - `rebase`, `merge --squash` and `detached head` all sound foreign still.
I think I've got a good start, though.
